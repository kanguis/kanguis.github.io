00:00:05,186 --> 00:00:08,613
This is the story of my idol Ram,

2
00:00:11,144 --> 00:00:13,976
a human revered as God.

3
00:00:14,745 --> 00:00:17,688
Whose life was a celebration
of righteousness.

4
00:00:18,022 --> 00:00:20,069
His name was Raghav.

5
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:25,272
Whose righteousness shattered
the arrogance of evil.

6
00:00:25,392 --> 00:00:27,939
This is the saga of Raghunandan

7
00:00:28,834 --> 00:00:31,772
An epic that has existed through the ages

8
00:00:32,265 --> 00:00:34,939
This is the story of Ramayan.

9
00:00:36,408 --> 00:00:38,129
Grant me some alms.

10
00:01:01,644 --> 00:01:03,103
You are the prince of Ayodhya.

11
00:01:03,311 --> 00:01:05,853
Just say the word
and the entire army will fight with you.

12
00:01:05,978 --> 00:01:07,519
That would be against my righteousness.

13
00:01:07,644 --> 00:01:10,782
So is your righteousness more valuable
to you than sister-in-law's life?

14
00:01:12,519 --> 00:01:14,894
Janaki is my life.

15
00:01:15,186 --> 00:01:19,103
But my righteousness
is more precious than my life.

16
00:01:24,103 --> 00:01:27,561
It doesn't suit you to sit at my feet.

17
00:01:27,826 --> 00:01:31,186
Our deeds define our character,
not our birth.

18
00:01:35,019 --> 00:01:37,103
Realize your own powers, Bajrang.

19
00:01:38,728 --> 00:01:42,058
Only you alone can do it.

20
00:01:42,894 --> 00:01:45,311
Hail Shri Ram!

21
00:01:57,519 --> 00:02:00,853
Raghav had broken the Shivdhanush
to marry me.

22
00:02:01,811 --> 00:02:03,936
Now he must break Raavan's arrogance.

23
00:02:07,916 --> 00:02:09,870
Do not fight for me!

24
00:02:10,275 --> 00:02:11,609
Fight for that glory,

25
00:02:11,734 --> 00:02:16,025
where people will bow down with respect
when they hear your name.

26
00:02:16,503 --> 00:02:17,347
Will you fight?

27
00:02:18,331 --> 00:02:23,169
Then march on and pierce
the enemy's hearts with the victory flag!

28
00:02:48,234 --> 00:02:50,929
You already have everything
this universe has to offer,

29
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,407
but you still remain a Demon.

30
00:02:55,785 --> 00:02:58,542
Make Lakshmi your consort
and you will become Narayan.

31
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:12,118
Hail Shri Ram!
